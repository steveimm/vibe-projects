/**
 * Opens Chrome on the `chrome://flags#enable-command-line-on-non-rooted-devices` page so the
 * user can flip the unlock toggle. Chrome blocks `chrome://` URLs from external intents for
 * security, so the cascade is:
 *
 * 1. **External intent + clipboard hint** — when Chrome resolves the chrome:// intent, fire
 *    [Intent.ACTION_VIEW] AND copy the URL to the clipboard with a hint toast. Lossless: even
 *    when Chrome silently drops the URL on its end (a real, observed behaviour), the user has
 *    a one-paste manual recovery. The previous "return success right after `startActivity`"
 *    design caused a silent-success loop where the user kept tapping the CTA.
 * 2. **Shizuku am start + clipboard hint** — `am start -d <url> -n com.android.chrome/...Main`.
 *    Used when ACTION_VIEW didn't dispatch (no Chrome handler resolves, or it threw). The
 *    `am` command runs as shell uid, which bypasses the external-intent block, so Chrome
 *    treats the URL as same-origin and renders it. Same silent-success risk as step 1 — `am`
 *    exits 0 when dispatched even if Chrome later drops the URL — so this branch ALSO copies
 *    the URL to the clipboard with the hint toast (additive, lossless).
 * 3. **Clipboard-only fallback** — copy the URL with a generic toast. Last resort for
 *    locked-down devices where neither launch path works.
 *
 * The injected [ShellRunner] is REQUIRED so step 2 actually runs in production. Passing null
 * would make the cascade two-step and re-open the silent-success class of bug.
