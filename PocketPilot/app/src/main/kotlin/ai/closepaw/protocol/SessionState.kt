 *      └──────────────────────Shutdown─────────────────────────────────┘
 *
 * Terminal state: Shutdown
 * - Shutdown: explicit user stop, idle timeout, or activity destruction
 *
 * TakeoverPending: Agent has been asked to pause but hasn't confirmed yet.
 * Resume is rejected in this state. Transitions to Paused once the agent
 * reaches a safe pause point (end of current turn).
 *
 * Hot Idle: After task completion, session enters Idle.
 * Only the AgentRunner state is cleared; platform (VirtualDisplay), history,
 * todos, scratchpad, LLM client, trace recorder, and event stream stay in
 * memory for instant follow-up. Resources are released only on Shutdown
 * via SessionServices.cleanup(). A 5-minute idle timeout auto-triggers Shutdown.
