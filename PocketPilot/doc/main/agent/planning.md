# Planning State & Context Hygiene

## Planning State System

The agent uses planning-state tools to track progress and share data between planner and executor.

`PromptBuilder` injects planning context as a dedicated memory message:
- Includes todos when todo list is non-empty
- Includes scratchpad JSON (truncated) when scratchpad is non-empty
- Omits memory section entirely when both are empty
- Keeps the memory block ahead of any active app-skill block and the final observation block

Runtime warning text (loop warning / final-turn warning) is injected in the observation section by `AgentTurnRunner.buildWarnings(...)`.

App-specific guidance is loaded separately per turn from
`app/src/main/assets/app_skills/<foreground-package>/SKILL.md` and injected after working memory.

## TodoState

→ See: `session/TodoState.kt`

Thread-safe todo list for tracking subgoals:

```kotlin
class TodoState {
    fun update(todos: List<Todo>)  // Replace entire list (validated)
    fun get(): List<Todo>          // Thread-safe retrieval
    fun clear()                    // Clear all todos
    fun toPromptContext(): String  // Markdown list for prompt context
}
```

**Constraints:**
- Only one todo can be `IN_PROGRESS` at a time (validated on `update()`)
- Full-list replacement model (no partial patch API)
- Thread-safe via `synchronized(lock)`

### Todo Model

```kotlin
data class Todo(
    val description: String,
    val status: TodoStatus  // PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, CANCELLED
)
```

→ See: `protocol/TodoModels.kt`

### write_todos Tool

→ See: `tool/impl/WriteTodosTool.kt`

```kotlin
write_todos(
    todos = [
        { description: "Open Gmail app", status: "COMPLETED" },
        { description: "Navigate to inbox", status: "IN_PROGRESS" },
        { description: "Find email from John", status: "PENDING" }
    ]
)
```

## ScratchpadState

→ See: `session/ScratchpadState.kt`

Thread-safe JSON-backed key-value memory for intermediate data. Internally stores a `JSONObject` — values can be any JSON type (String, Number, Boolean, JSONArray, JSONObject):

```kotlin
class ScratchpadState {
    fun write(key: String, value: Any)   // Upsert single key-value pair
    fun read(key: String): Any?          // Returns native JSON type or null
    fun delete(key: String): Boolean
    fun list(): List<String>             // Sorted keys
    fun toJsonObject(): JSONObject       // Deep copy for checkpoint serialization
    fun toPromptContext(): String        // JSON with per-value truncation

    companion object {
        const val MAX_ENTRIES = 20
        const val MAX_KEY_LENGTH = 100
        const val MAX_VALUE_LENGTH = 2048
        const val DISPLAY_TRUNCATE_LENGTH = 200
        const val TOTAL_BUDGET = 3000
    }
}
```

`toPromptContext()` renders all keys and values as a JSON object. Values longer than `DISPLAY_TRUNCATE_LENGTH` are truncated with a `// truncated` comment. Total output is capped at `TOTAL_BUDGET` chars — beyond-budget keys show `"..." // use read`.

**Use cases:**
- Store extracted info from one screen for later turns
- Persist critical facts across app navigation
- Share structured handoff data between planner and executor

### scratchpad Tool

→ See: `tool/impl/ScratchpadTool.kt`

```kotlin
// Write: content is a JSON object string — supports batch writes in a single call
scratchpad(action = "write", content = """{"recipient_email": "john@example.com", "subject": "Meeting"}""")

// Read: returns value for a specific key
scratchpad(action = "read", key = "recipient_email")

// Delete: removes a key
scratchpad(action = "delete", key = "recipient_email")
```

## Context Hygiene (History Compression)

To control token usage, `HistoryManager` proactively downgrades old screen
observations on every `addItem(SCREEN_OBSERVATION)`. Context-window pressure
is handled by per-turn `Compactor` summarization (see
[memory.md → Conversation History & Compaction](memory.md#conversation-history--compaction)).

### Key Design Decisions

| Aspect | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| **History** | User/assistant messages + function calls + function outputs, classified by `MessageKind` |
| **Current Screen** | Current turn always includes full screen JSON in observation section |
| **Screen History** | Each turn records screen JSON as `ResponseItem.Message(kind = SCREEN_OBSERVATION)` |
| **Screen Compression** | `HistoryManager` proactively downgrades old screens on every `addItem()`; keeps last `HistoryConfig.recentFullScreens` (default 3) full |
| **Context-window pressure** | Per-turn `Compactor.maybeCompact` LLM-summarizes the older prefix when tokens exceed `contextWindow − reserve`; reactive `forceCompactNow` retries once on `ContextWindowExceededException` |
| **Compression owner** | Single owner: `HistoryManager` for screen downgrade; `Compactor` for cross-turn summarization. `PromptBuilder` is read-only pass-through. |

### Local Compression (HistoryManager)

`HistoryManager.compress(target)` now only runs normalization + screen
downgrade and returns a `CompressionResult`; it never drops content. The old
lossy phased eviction (group-aware oldest-first deletion + breadcrumb digest)
was removed when `Compactor` took over context-window pressure.

### Data Flow

```
Turn N                                  Turn N+1
  |                                       |
  |- Perceive: capture screen             |- Perceive: capture screen
  |                                       |
  |- Think: LLM with                      |- Think: LLM with
  |  - History (older screens auto-       |  - History (proactively compressed)
  |    downgraded by HistoryManager)      |
  |  - Working Memory (todos/scratchpad)  |  - Working Memory (todos/scratchpad)
  |  - App Skill (if active package has one) |  - App Skill (if active package has one)
  |  - Current observation JSON           |  - Current observation JSON
  |                                       |
  |- Act: execute tool                    |- Act: execute tool
  |                                       |
  '- Observe: record full screen JSON     '- Observe: record full screen JSON
     in history (kind=SCREEN_OBSERVATION)    in history (triggers downgrade of older screens)
```

## Why Context Hygiene Matters

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Token explosion from full a11y trees | Proactive screen downgrade on every new observation |
| Stale screen-state confusion | Re-capture every turn and place current observation at input tail |
| History bloat | `Compactor` LLM-summarizes the older prefix when context-window pressure builds (proactive per-turn check + reactive retry on provider rejection) |
| KV cache thrashing | Summarization keeps a stable recent tail (`keepRecentTokens`, default 20k) so the prefix changes infrequently |
| Cross-turn data loss | Explicit persistence via scratchpad/todos |

## Planning Events

Planning-state mutation events (`TodosUpdated`, `ScratchpadUpdated`) were removed (pc-dead-event-cleanup, 2026-04-16) — no consumer existed. Todo/scratchpad state is observed via the UI history stream and the tool call results (`write_todos`, `scratchpad`) alone.
