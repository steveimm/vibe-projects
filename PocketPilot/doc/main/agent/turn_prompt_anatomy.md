# Turn Prompt Anatomy

> What each turn sends to the LLM: instructions, input items, and filtered tools.
> Last updated: 2026-05-16

## Overview

Each turn request is assembled by three runtime pieces:

1. `TurnPlanningPhaseRunner` chooses warnings and system prompt
2. `PromptBuilder` constructs `input` items
3. `Turn` sends `instructions/input/tools` to the selected model and parses response

Primary wiring:
- `agent/TurnPlanningPhaseRunner.kt`
- `agent/cognition/prompt/PromptBuilder.kt`
- `agent/Turn.kt`

---

## 1. System Prompt (Instructions)

System prompt text is sourced from `DefaultRoleDef` and passed to `Turn`.

- Main agent (`SessionAgentRunner`):
  - `DefaultRoleDef.systemPrompt`
- Subagent (`IsolatedSubAgentRunner`):
  - Reuses `DefaultRoleDef.systemPrompt` with runtime tool exclusions

`AgentTurnRunner` enforces prompt presence with `requireNotNull(config.systemPrompt)`.

### Prompt Structure

The default role prompt keeps only cross-tool policy in the system prompt:

1. **Role** — Agent identity and success criteria
2. **Critical Rules** — Turn-shape, evidence, retry/pivot, and coordination policy
3. **Execution Loop** — Observe → act/delegate → verify
4. **Working Memory** — How to use todos and scratchpad
5. **Task Modes** — Manipulation, information gathering, blocked/unsupported handling
6. **Completion** — Verification doctrine before `complete_task`
7. **Device Environment** — Runtime context (device, screen, date)
8. **Available Skills catalog** (optional) — Appended by `TurnPlanningPhaseRunner` from `AgentSkillManager.catalogPrompt()` when one or more valid skills exist under `filesDir/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. One-line descriptions only; bodies are loaded on demand via `activate_skill`.

Tool-local semantics now live in tool descriptions, app-specific guidance lives in
`app/src/main/assets/app_skills/<package>/SKILL.md`, and task/capability guidance lives in
`filesDir/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (Agent Skills, see [agent_skills.md](agent_skills.md)).

→ See: `agent/definition/DefaultAgentDef.kt`

## 2. Input Items Composition

`PromptBuilder.buildInputItems(observation, warnings, ..., appSkill, activatedAgentSkills)` constructs the full
`input` list in fixed order:

1. **History section** (`HistoryManager.forPrompt()`, normalized)
2. **Working memory section** (optional — todos + scratchpad)
3. **Recalled memory section** (optional — cross-session memories from `MemoryRecaller`)
4. **App skill section** (optional single user message)
5. **Activated agent skills section** (optional — bodies of `/skill-name` mentions in goal)
6. **Current observation section** (screen JSON + optional screenshot)

### 2.1 History Section

History items are converted from `ResponseItem` to Responses API `ResponseInputItem`:

- `ResponseItem.Message` → `easy_input_message`
- `ResponseItem.FunctionCall` → `function_call`
- `ResponseItem.FunctionCallOutput` → `function_call_output`

Screen observations are tagged by `ResponseItem.Message(kind = MessageKind.SCREEN_OBSERVATION)`.
To control growth, `HistoryManager` proactively keeps only the last `recentFullScreens` full screen observations and compresses older ones to:

`Screen: {N} elements (compressed)`

Default retained full observations: `recentFullScreens = 3`.

When older history is summarized by `Compactor`, a single `ResponseItem.Message(kind = MessageKind.COMPACTION_SUMMARY)` replaces the discarded prefix. `COMPACTION_SUMMARY` is rendered as a **user-role** `easy_input_message` whose content is prefixed with:

```
[Context checkpoint from earlier work in this session]

<summary text>
```

This makes provenance unambiguous: the model reads it as a runtime-supplied
handoff, not as its own prior assistant output. The full-history pass-through
in `HistoryManager.forPrompt()` still normalizes call/output pairs around it.

→ See: [memory.md](memory.md#conversation-history--compaction) for the compaction algorithm and CAS semantics.

### 2.2 Working Memory Section (Optional)

When todos or scratchpad keys exist, a single user message is inserted:

```text
## Working Memory

### Todo List
1. [IN_PROGRESS] ...

### Scratchpad
- key_a
- key_b
```

- Omitted when both todo list and scratchpad are empty.
- Scratchpad exposes keys only (not values) in the memory section.

### 2.3 Recalled Memory Section (Optional)

When `MemoryRecaller.recall(currentPackageName)` returns content, it is injected as a single user message after working memory. This provides cross-session learnings to the LLM.

```text
## Recalled Memory

These are durable learnings from previous sessions. Use them when relevant.

### App: com.android.settings
- [2026-03-11] Developer Options is under System > Developer Options
- [2026-03-11] "About phone" scroll position resets on back-navigate
```

Recall is deterministic and scope-first (user → device → app). Each file is
read raw; blank files and files exceeding `MemoryStore.maxFileBytes` (8 KB)
are skipped. There is no per-scope sub-budget — the per-file cap is the only
size gate.

→ See: [memory.md](memory.md) for full memory system details.

### 2.4 App Skill Section (Optional)

When the foreground package matches an asset under `app_skills/<package>/SKILL.md`,
`TurnPlanningPhaseRunner` loads the whole file through `AppSkillRepository` and injects:

```text
## App Skill
Package: net.gsantner.markor

...full SKILL.md contents...
```

This keeps app knowledge out of the static system prompt while ensuring the active app's guidance
is adjacent to the current observation.

App skill frontmatter follows the agentskills.io-compatible format:

```yaml
---
name: app-markor
description: App-specific guidance for Markor.
metadata:
  package: net.gsantner.markor
---
```

`name` is `app-<short-name>` (lowercase-hyphen, user-recognizable). `metadata.package` carries the Android package name. The on-disk directory is still keyed by package name; lookup uses the directory, not the `metadata.package` field. The shared `SkillFrontmatterParser` strips frontmatter for both App Skills and Agent Skills.

### 2.5 Activated Agent Skills Section (Optional)

When the user goal contains `/skill-name` mentions matching skills in the catalog, the bodies are activated by `TurnPlanningPhaseRunner` and injected as a single user message AFTER the app skill but BEFORE the observation:

```text
## Skill: calendar-date-math
...full SKILL.md body...

## Skill: image-table-reading
...full SKILL.md body...
```

Bodies are loaded only on the first turn after explicit mention; subsequent turns retain them in conversation history. Model-driven activation via the `activate_skill` tool returns the body as a tool result and follows the same compaction rules as any tool output.

→ See: [agent_skills.md](agent_skills.md) for the full Agent Skills system.

### 2.6 Observation Section

Final user message always includes current screen JSON. An optional `Turn N`
header is rendered when a positive turn number is supplied — purely informational,
not a `Turn N/M` budget. There is no "FINAL TURN" warning; the agent runs
without a fixed turn cap (see [loop.md](loop.md#auto-compaction)).

````text
Turn 7

[warning] ...optional loop-detection warning...

Screen state (N elements):
```json
...
```
````

If screenshot input is available and backend supports vision, the message also attaches image content and appends:

`Screenshot attached (compressed).`

### Warnings Included

Warnings are prepared in `AgentTurnRunner.buildWarnings(...)`:
- Loop warning from `LoopDetectionPolicy` (factual message only — no severity levels)

> See: `agent/cognition/policy/LoopDetectionPolicy.kt`

---

## 3. Screen Observation Recording

`TurnPlanningPhaseRunner` creates a canonical `TurnObservation` from the screen snapshot and perception config. Both prompt rendering and history recording project from this single payload — `Perceptor.toPromptJson()` is called once.

- `PromptBuilder` wraps `observation.screenBlock` with turn-specific decorations (budget, warnings, screenshot note)
- History records `observation.screenBlock` directly as `kind = MessageKind.SCREEN_OBSERVATION`

No ordering dependency: the observation is immutable, so prompt building and history recording can happen in any order.

→ See: `agent/cognition/prompt/TurnObservation.kt`, `agent/TurnPlanningPhaseRunner.kt`, `history/HistoryManager.kt`

---

## 4. Tool Schema Set

`Turn` generates tool schemas from `ToolRegistry` and applies `allowedToolNames` filtering.

Role-level allowlists are defined by `DefaultRoleDef` and filtered at runtime:

| Runtime | Available Tools |
|---------|-----------------|
| Main agent | `mobile_action`, `system_button`, `wait`, `open_app`, `shell`, `write_todos`, `scratchpad`, `complete_task`, `ask_user`, `remember_experience`, `delegate_task`, `browser_script`, `activate_skill`* |
| Subagent | Main-agent tools minus `delegate_task` and `remember_experience` |

*`activate_skill` is registered only when `AgentSkillManager` finds at least one valid skill under `filesDir/skills/`. If no skills are present, the tool is omitted entirely.

Tool calls returned by the model but outside the allowlist are dropped before completion checks.

→ See: `agent/Turn.kt`, `agent/definition/`

---

## 5. Request Skeleton

Conceptual shape of one request:

```json
{
  "model": "glm-5",
  "instructions": "You are a standalone Android automation agent...",
  "input": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Goal: ..."},
    {"type": "function_call", "id": "...", "name": "write_todos", "arguments": "{...}"},
    {"type": "function_call_output", "call_id": "...", "output": "Success: ..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "## Working Memory\n..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "## App Skill\nPackage: net.gsantner.markor\n..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Screen state (16 elements):\n```json\n...\n```"}
  ],
  "tools": [
    {"type": "function", "name": "mobile_action", "parameters": {...}},
    {"type": "function", "name": "complete_task", "parameters": {...}}
  ]
}
```

---

## 6. Turn Completion Semantics

`Turn.processResponse(...)` marks completion when either:

- a `complete_task` call exists, or
- there are no tool calls and assistant text is present

`TurnPlanningPhaseRunner` then applies `TurnToolPolicy` arbitration for one-tool-per-turn execution and completion deferral rules.

### Tool Call Recovery

When the LLM returns tool calls formatted as text instead of structured tool calls, `Turn` attempts recovery:
- Parses JSON objects with `name`/`tool_name` and `arguments`/`args` fields
- Matches inline `toolName {...}` patterns
- Strips markdown code fences before parsing

→ See: `agent/Turn.kt`

## 7. Trace Artifacts

When trace is enabled, request/response artifacts are written under `trace/artifacts/`:

| Artifact Folder | Content |
|-----------------|---------|
| `llm_system_prompt/` | `{seq}_turn_{n}_system.txt` |
| `llm_user_context/` | `{seq}_turn_{n}_user_context.txt` |
| `llm_full_prompt/` | `{seq}_turn_{n}_full_prompt.txt` |
| `llm_input_items/` | `{seq}_turn_{n}_llm_input_items.json` |
| `llm_history/` | `{seq}_turn_{n}_history.json` |
| `llm_tool_calls/` | `{seq}_turn_{n}_tool_calls.json` |

Additional artifacts include raw/sanitized a11y trees, screenshots, tool args/results, and post-action observation records.
