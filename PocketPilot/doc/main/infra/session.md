# Session Infrastructure

> AgentSession, SessionCoordinator, SessionServices, and session lifecycle.

## AgentSession

→ See: `session/AgentSession.kt`

Thin lifecycle manager. It does not implement planning/action logic directly.

**Responsibilities:**
- Process `Op` from UI
- Emit `AgentEvent` to UI (SharedFlow with replay=8, buffer=64)
- Manage session state transitions (`Created`/`Running`/`Paused`/`Idle`/`Shutdown`)
- Manage per-task lifecycle via `handleUserInput()`
- Coordinate checkpoint persistence via `SessionCheckpointCoordinator`
- Manage Hot Idle (platform stays alive; idle timeout; idempotent `platform.start()` on follow-up)
- Delegate runtime start/stop to `SessionAgentRunner`

### Key Methods

```kotlin
class AgentSession {
    suspend fun submit(op: Op)             // Submit an operation
    val events: SharedFlow<AgentEvent>     // Event stream for UI
    val state: StateFlow<SessionState>     // Current session state
}
```

### Platform Lifecycle

Platform is acquired on first task and stays alive across Hot Idle until shutdown:

- `Created → Running` (first task): `platform.start()`
- `Running → Idle` (task complete): platform stays alive (no `platform.stop()`); only `agentRunner.clear()` runs
- `Idle → Running` (follow-up): `platform.start()` (idempotent — no-op if already running)
- `Any → Shutdown`: `services.cleanup()` closes browser resources, stops platform, clears history, releases LLM clients, closes trace recorder

If `platform.start()` fails on follow-up, session re-arms idle timeout and stays in Idle.

→ See: [Platform](platform.md) for `PlatformFactory` and `VirtualDisplayPlatform` details.

### State Transitions

```
Created ──(UserInput)──► Running ──(Takeover)──► TakeoverPending ──(agent pause-point)──► Paused
                           │  ▲                                                              │
                           │  └────────────────────(Resume)────────────────────────────────-─┘
                           │
                           └──(TaskCompleted)──► Idle ──(UserInput)──► Running
                                                  │
                                 Any ──(Shutdown)──► Shutdown ◄──(IdleTimeout)──┘
```

> See: [Session State Machine](../ui/session/state_machine.md) for formal transition table and resource ownership.

### Hot Idle

After task completion, the session enters `Idle` instead of shutting down. Only `AgentRunner` state is cleared; platform (VirtualDisplay/recording), history, todos, scratchpad, LLM client, trace recorder, and the event SharedFlow remain live for instant follow-up. Auto-shutdown after 5 minutes of inactivity (`IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS = 300_000`).

→ See: [Session User Flows](../ui/session/user_flows.md) for follow-up task flow.

### Checkpoint Coordination

→ See: `session/SessionCheckpointCoordinator.kt`

Persists session state for process-death recovery. Writes `context-*.json` files alongside `session-*.json`. Watches `HistoryManager`, `TodoState`, and `ScratchpadState` mutation listeners to schedule incremental checkpoints. Checkpoint serialization stores scratchpad as `scratchpadJson: String` (raw JSON string) rather than a typed map. Checkpoint state is derived from runtime `SessionState`:

| SessionState | CheckpointState | Written when |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Running/Paused | `RUNNING_DIRTY` | Mutation listener (debounced 500ms) |
| Idle | `IDLE_READY` | Mutation listener, or force-flushed on TaskCompleted |
| Shutdown | `CLOSED` | Force-flushed on session shutdown |

`AgentSession.reload(snapshot)` hydrates a new session from a `SessionRuntimeSnapshot`, restoring history/todos/scratchpad (scratchpad is deserialized from the `scratchpadJson` string field). Returns session in `Created` state.

---

## SessionCoordinator

→ See: `session/SessionCoordinator.kt`

Coordinates session lifecycle and input queuing between `MainActivity` and `AgentSession`. Replaces the previous timer-loop drain pattern with an event-driven approach.

**Responsibilities:**
- Own `currentSession` reference and `selectedSessionForReload`
- Serialize session creation via internal `Mutex` (tryLock fast-fail for concurrent requests)
- Queue user inputs during busy state (Running/Paused)
- Drain queued inputs automatically when session transitions to Idle/Created (StateFlow observation)
- Capture dead session identity on Shutdown for cold-idle auto-reload

### Key Methods

```kotlin
class SessionCoordinator(scope: CoroutineScope) {
    suspend fun submit(text: String): SubmitResult     // Send or queue input
    suspend fun createAndSubmit(text: String, create)   // Create session under lock
    fun enqueue(text: String)                           // Direct queue (lock unavailable fallback)
    fun attachSession(session: AgentSession)            // Rebind from service
    fun detachSession()                                 // Switch to history viewing
    suspend fun clearSession()                          // Shutdown + teardown
    fun consumeDeadSessionFileName(): String?           // One-shot dead session ref for auto-reload
}
```

### Cold-Idle Auto-Reload

When `submit()` detects `SessionState.Shutdown`, it captures the dying session's recording `fileName` before teardown. On the next user input, `MainActivity.ensureSessionAndSend` uses this dead ref + the still-set `activeSessionId` to construct a `SessionInfo` and route through the existing checkpoint reload path. If auto-reload fails, falls back to a fresh session silently.

**Dead rebind guard:** `MainActivity.rebindActiveServiceSessionIfNeeded()` (called in `onStart()` after Activity recreation) skips sessions in `Shutdown` state to avoid rebinding a dead session. The next user message will create a fresh one instead.

→ See: [Session User Flows](../ui/session/user_flows.md) for the full cold-idle recovery flow.

---

## SessionServices

→ See: `session/SessionServices.kt`

Dependency-injection container for all session-scoped services. Created via factory method with three bootstrappers.

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `toolRegistry` | Tool discovery and schema generation |
| `toolRouter` | Tool execution + approval lifecycle |
| `historyManager` | Conversation history + compression (thread-safe via `@Synchronized`) |
| `sessionState` | Shared planning state (todos + scratchpad) |
| `policyEngine` | Tool approval decisions |
| `platform` | Android operations |
| `config` | Session configuration |
| `llmClient` | LLM client (OpenAI or local LFM) |
| `modelCatalog` | Database of available models and providers |
| `llmClientFactory` | Factory for creating LLM clients (cached by provider) |
| `traceRecorder` | Trace persistence sink |
| `recordingService` | Session history recording |
| `browserSessionManager` | Session-scoped owner for browser CDP/WebView/Shizuku resources |
| `termuxSnapshot` | Immutable Termux bridge capability snapshot for this session |
| `appSkillRepository` | Loads `app_skills/<package>/SKILL.md` assets for per-turn prompt injection |
| `userResponseChannel` | Suspension bridge for `ask_user` tool (CompletableDeferred) |
| `memoryStore` | Persistent cross-session memory I/O (`memory/MemoryStore.kt`) |
| `memoryRecaller` | Elastic-budget recall for per-turn prompt injection (`memory/MemoryRecaller.kt`) |

### Bootstrappers

Creation is split into three bootstrappers:

| Bootstrapper | Creates |
|-------------|---------|
| `SessionLlmBootstrapper` | `ModelCatalog` (from `assets/llm_models.json`), `LLMClientFactory`, `LLMClient` |
| `SessionToolingBootstrapper` | `PolicyEngine`, `AgentSessionState`, `ToolRegistry`, `ToolRouter` |
| `SessionHistoryBootstrapper` | `HistoryManager` (maxTokenBudget=18,000, AGGRESSIVE truncation), `SessionRecordingService` |

`SessionServices.create(...)` also wires `AssetAppSkillRepository(context.assets)` directly. The
planning runner uses it every turn to load package-scoped app guidance without storing app-skill
state in the session itself.

Before constructing `AgentSkillManager`, `SessionServices.create(...)` runs
`BundledAgentSkillInstaller(context.assets).install(filesDir/skills)`. This seeds bundled Agent
Skills such as `browser-use` from APK assets into the runtime skill directory and substitutes
installed absolute snippet paths into `SKILL.md`. A `.install-complete` sentinel marks the last
successful bundled install; without that sentinel, install failure is treated as first-install
failure and aborts session creation instead of silently hiding the skill from the catalog.

Browser runtime wiring also lives in `SessionServices.create(...)`: it creates `BrowserSessionManager`
with `context.applicationContext`, registers `BrowserScriptTool`, and injects
`DefaultBrowserScriptCapabilityGate` with `AppSettingsStore`, Shizuku status, preflight, invoker, and
trace sink. `SessionToolingBootstrapper` stays Android-free and does not own `Context`, WebViews, or
Shizuku bindings.

→ See: [browser.md](browser.md) for the browser runtime lifecycle and policy rule.

Termux runtime wiring is also captured at session creation. `SessionServices.create(...)` asks
`TermuxBridgeManager.ensureReadyForSession(...)` to restart an already-deployed idle bridge without
running package install, then snapshots `TermuxCapabilitySnapshot`. `SessionToolingBootstrapper`
uses that snapshot to register `termux_shell`, and `AgentRoleDef.resolve(...)` uses the same
snapshot to inject the workspace-shell prompt for Standalone, Planner, and Executor roles. The
snapshot remains fixed for the session, including Hot Idle follow-up tasks.

→ See: [termux_shell.md](../app/termux_shell.md) for setup states, bridge lifecycle, and OEM limits.

### Cleanup

`SessionServices.cleanup()` cancels active tools, closes `browserSessionManager`, then calls
`platform.stop()` to release platform resources (virtual display teardown, `ImageReader` release).
Each cleanup step is wrapped in try-catch so one teardown failure does not skip later cleanup.

### Creation

```kotlin
val services = SessionServices.create(config, platform, apiKeys, context, scope, traceRecorder)
```

Built-in tool registration includes:
- `mobile_action`, `open_app`, `system_button`, `wait`
- `write_todos`, `scratchpad`, `complete_task`
- `shell` (restricted file-related shell command execution)
- `termux_shell` (full bash through Termux, only when the session snapshot is enabled and ready)
- `remember_experience` (registered in `SessionServices.create()`)
- `browser_script` (registered in `SessionServices.create()` with session-scoped browser runtime)

`delegate_task` and `ask_user` are not part of static built-in registration. They are attached lazily by `SessionAgentRunner.start()` when required.

---

## SessionAgentRunner

→ See: `session/SessionAgentRunner.kt`

Bridges `AgentSession` and runtime `Agent`:
- Chooses the main agent definition via `AgentDefRegistry.main`
- Builds `AgentExecutionConfig` from selected definition (prompt + allowed tools + execution role)
- Registers `delegate_task` when the resolved main-agent allowlist includes it
- Always registers `ask_user` with `UserResponseChannel` and event emitter
- Handles lifecycle (`start`, `pause`, `resume`, `stop`, `cancelJob`, `shutdown`)
- Wires the single delegatable `DefaultRoleDef` + `IsolatedSubAgentRunner`

**Cancellation ordering:** Both `cancelJob()` and `shutdown()` complete the `cancellationSignal` **before** cancelling the coroutine job. This ensures the `CancellationException` catch block in the agent coroutine sees `signal.isCompleted == true` and reports `UserRequested` rather than an unexpected cancellation.

`handleInterrupt()` calls both `agentRunner.stop()` (cooperative flag) and `agentRunner.cancelJob()` (immediate coroutine cancellation). This ensures the agent stops promptly even during tool suspension (e.g., `ask_user` awaiting user input).

### Unified Agent Mode

There is one main agent role (`DefaultRoleDef`). Delegation is always available when `delegate_task` is present in the resolved allowlist; subagents reuse the default role with runtime exclusions for recursive delegation and long-term memory writes.

### Takeover Timing

When the user requests takeover (`Op.Takeover`), `AgentSession.handleTakeover()` calls `agentRunner.pause()`, which returns `Deferred<Unit>`. The session awaits this deferred before emitting `SessionTakeover`. Thus:

1. User taps takeover → capsule shows TakeoverPending immediately
2. Session calls `agentRunner.pause()`, receives deferred
3. Agent finishes current turn, then actually pauses (loop top check)
4. Deferred completes → session emits `SessionTakeover`
5. Capsule transitions to Takeover

The capsule's TakeoverPending state reflects reality: handover is not instant while the agent finishes its current action.

---

## AgentSessionState

→ See: `session/AgentSessionState.kt`

Shared state container accessible to agent and tools:
- `TodoState` - current todo list
- `ScratchpadState` - JSON-backed memory (stores `JSONObject` internally)

---

## Lifecycle Events

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `SessionStarted` | First transition from Created → Running (goal) |
| `TaskStarted` | New task begins (taskId, input) |
| `TaskCompleted` | Task ends (taskId, result, reason). Preceded by trace flush. |
| `SessionCompleted` | Session terminates (result, reason) |

### Task Completion Sequence

`handleAgentComplete()` executes these steps in order:
1. **Flush trace** — `services.traceRecorder.flush()` ensures all trace data is on disk before the eval runner can force-stop the process
2. **Emit TaskCompleted** — notifies UI and external listeners
3. **Checkpoint** — persists session state for recovery
4. **Transition to Idle** — releases platform resources
5. **Clear runner** — releases agent reference
6. **Arm idle timeout** — auto-shutdown after inactivity

→ See: [Protocol](../protocol/overview.md)

## Quick Reference

### Starting the Agent

```kotlin
// In AgentService
val session = AgentSession.create(config, accessibilityService, scope, apiKeys)

// Primary entry point
session.submit(Op.UserInput("Open Settings"))
```

### Submitting Operations

```kotlin
session.submit(Op.UserInput("Check my email"))            // Start task
session.submit(Op.Takeover)                               // User takes over
session.submit(Op.Resume)                                 // Resume after takeover
session.submit(Op.Supplement("also check spam folder"))   // Inject mid-task context
session.submit(Op.UserResponse(callId, "yes"))            // Respond to ask_user
session.submit(Op.Interrupt)                              // Cancel agent job + stop task, session stays Idle
session.submit(Op.Shutdown)                               // Terminate session
session.submit(Op.Approve(actionId, decision, scope, packageName)) // Respond to app-level approval
```

Positive approvals are package-scoped: `ApprovalScope.SESSION` allows the app for
the current session, and `ApprovalScope.ALWAYS` persists the app allow-list entry.
`ApprovalDecision.DENIED` cancels only the current pending tool call and does not
write a deny-list entry.

### Observing Events

```kotlin
session.events.collect { event ->
    when (event) {
        is AgentEvent.TaskStarted -> showThinkingUI()
        is AgentEvent.MessageDelta -> appendText(event.delta)
        is AgentEvent.TaskCompleted -> enableInputField()
        // ...
    }
}
```

## UserResponseChannel

→ See: `session/UserResponseChannel.kt`

Suspension bridge between the `ask_user` tool and the UI. Uses `AtomicReference<PendingRequest?>` for thread safety. Only one pending request is allowed at a time.

| Method | Called By | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `awaitResponse(callId)` | `AskUserTool.execute()` | Suspend until user responds |
| `deliver(callId, response)` | `AgentSession.handleUserResponse()` | Complete the deferred with user's answer |
| `cancel()` | `AgentSession.handleInterrupt/Shutdown()` | Cancel pending request |

**Exit paths:**
- **Normal**: User responds → `deliver()` → deferred completes → tool returns success
- **Timeout**: `withTimeoutOrNull(5min)` → returns `null` → `finally` clears state → tool returns "timed out"
- **Cancellation**: `cancel()` → `CancellationException` → tool returns `Cancelled`
