# mobile_action

> Current deep dive for the screen-interaction tool.
> Last updated: 2026-05-26

## Purpose

`mobile_action` is the single tool for screen-targeted interactions on the real device. It owns:

- `click`
- `long_press`
- `type`
- `scroll`
- `swipe`

It does not own app launch, system buttons, task completion, or user interaction policy.

The tool contract is defined in [MobileActionTool.kt](../../../../app/src/main/kotlin/ai/closepaw/tool/impl/MobileActionTool.kt) and the runtime glue lives in [MobileActionInvocation.kt](../../../../app/src/main/kotlin/ai/closepaw/tool/impl/MobileActionInvocation.kt).

## Contract

### Targeting model

For `click`, `long_press`, and targeted `type`, targeting is canonicalized by priority:

1. `element_index`
2. `text` (with optional `text_index`)
3. `x` and `y`

When multiple target fields are provided in one call, higher-priority fields stay canonical and lower-priority fields are treated as hints.

`x/y` may accompany a semantic target as a **coordinate hint**. In that case the semantic target stays canonical and the hint is only fallback evidence when semantic resolution fails (see Coordinate-hint normalization below). The bare `x/y` shape (no semantic target) is allowed for `click`, `long_press`, and `type` — it resolves to a pure coordinate target.

`scroll` accepts an optional semantic target (`element_index` or `text`) to scope the scroll area, and `x/y` only as a coordinate hint to that semantic target. Bare `x/y` on scroll is **rejected** because scroll is area-based, not point-based, and a hint without a semantic anchor has no scroll area to operate on.

`swipe` does not use semantic targeting. It requires raw `start: [x, y]` and `end: [x, y]`.

### Coordinate-hint normalization

The Codex backend sometimes emits both semantic selectors and raw coordinates in one call, e.g. `{"action":"click","element_index":14,"text":"Save","x":540,"y":1230}`. The runtime normalizes this at the tool boundary:

- The semantic target is **primary**. Execution targets the resolved semantic node, not the hint coordinate.
- If the semantic target resolves, the call executes against the semantic target even when hint coordinates are outside the resolved bounds. The hint is ignored in that case; it does not create an ambiguity failure.
- If the semantic target **does not resolve** but a hint is present, the call falls back to the coordinate with a warning attached to the success/failure message, and the resolver result is flagged `coordinateFallback=true`. For point actions (`click`, `long_press`), the fallback skips node-action channels and uses gesture channels only (there is no resolved node to dispatch against). For `type`, the fallback uses `TapAt` + `SetTextOnFocused` (skipping `SetTextOnNodeAt`).
- If the semantic target does not resolve and no hint is present, the call fails the same way it did before this normalization.
- `scroll` is the explicit exception: it **never uses coordinate fallback**. If the scroll's semantic target cannot resolve (or only resolves through coordinate fallback), the scroll fails outright — no synthetic bounds, no full-display fallback. Coordinate fallback to a single point has no meaningful scroll area.

### Validation guarantees

The tool rejects:

- unknown actions
- legacy bounds selectors (`x1/y1/x2/y2`)
- partial coordinates (only one of `x`/`y` supplied)
- negative coordinates or `element_index`
- bare `x/y` on `scroll`
- `text_index` without `text` when there is no higher-priority target

This keeps targeting single-path. The executor does not run cross-selector fallback.

## Execution architecture

`mobile_action` has three runtime layers:

1. Tool contract
2. Action executors
3. Atomic platform primitives

### 1. Tool contract

[MobileActionTool.kt](../../../../app/src/main/kotlin/ai/closepaw/tool/impl/MobileActionTool.kt) does four things:

- defines the schema and prompt-facing description
- validates parameters
- parses the target into a typed `Target`
- routes to the executor for the selected action

This layer should stay dumb. It should not know about Android fallback quirks.

### 2. Action executors

The executor layer is where almost all real action semantics live:

- [ClickExecutor.kt](../../../../app/src/main/kotlin/ai/closepaw/tool/action/ClickExecutor.kt)
- [LongPressExecutor.kt](../../../../app/src/main/kotlin/ai/closepaw/tool/action/LongPressExecutor.kt)
- [ScrollExecutor.kt](../../../../app/src/main/kotlin/ai/closepaw/tool/action/ScrollExecutor.kt)
- [TypeExecutor.kt](../../../../app/src/main/kotlin/ai/closepaw/tool/action/TypeExecutor.kt)
- [SwipeExecutor.kt](../../../../app/src/main/kotlin/ai/closepaw/tool/action/SwipeExecutor.kt)
- shared helpers:
  - [PointActionExecutorCore.kt](../../../../app/src/main/kotlin/ai/closepaw/tool/action/PointActionExecutorCore.kt)
  - [TargetResolver.kt](../../../../app/src/main/kotlin/ai/closepaw/tool/action/TargetResolver.kt)
  - [PostActionAnalysis.kt](../../../../app/src/main/kotlin/ai/closepaw/tool/action/PostActionAnalysis.kt) — accepts `appClassifier` for BLOCKED-app observation masking
  - [UiChangeDetector.kt](../../../../app/src/main/kotlin/ai/closepaw/tool/action/UiChangeDetector.kt)
  - [ActionPriorityOrder.kt](../../../../app/src/main/kotlin/ai/closepaw/tool/action/ActionPriorityOrder.kt)

This is the single smart layer.

### 3. Atomic platform primitives

The platform layer should be mechanism-only:

- [AccessibilityPlatform.kt](../../../../app/src/main/kotlin/ai/closepaw/platform/AccessibilityPlatform.kt)
- [NodeActionPerformer.kt](../../../../app/src/main/kotlin/ai/closepaw/platform/NodeActionPerformer.kt)
- [AccessibilityGestureInjector.kt](../../../../app/src/main/kotlin/ai/closepaw/platform/AccessibilityGestureInjector.kt)
- [UIAction.kt](../../../../app/src/main/kotlin/ai/closepaw/platform/UIAction.kt)

It exposes atomic calls like:

- node click at point
- gesture tap at point
- node long click
- gesture long press
- set text on node
- set text on focused field
- scroll node
- swipe gesture

The platform answers "was the Android API call accepted?" The executor layer answers "did this action path achieve an observable effect?"

## Action semantics

### click

`click` uses [PointActionExecutorCore.kt](../../../../app/src/main/kotlin/ai/closepaw/tool/action/PointActionExecutorCore.kt) with this channel order:

1. `node_action_click`
2. `gesture_tap`

For coordinate targets, node click is skipped because there is no semantic target.

For semantic targets, the runtime first resolves the requested element, then may promote it to a containing actionable row if the resolved child is not itself clickable.

Current promotion rule:

- if the resolved semantic element is not clickable and not long-clickable
- find the smallest clickable or long-clickable container that contains its bounds
- within that container, search for actionable children materially smaller than the container (< 80% area)
- pick the child closest to the original resolved point; use its center as the click point
- if no qualifying child exists, fall back to the container center

This exists because many Android lists expose text nodes as children inside a clickable row. The child-hotspot selection avoids the failure mode where `container.center` lands on a dead zone for `ACTION_CLICK` (e.g., Files app row center).

When retargeting occurs, a diagnostic note is added to the warnings list (e.g., "Retargeted from (x1,y1) to child at (x2,y2)") for observability in traces and LLM output.

### long_press

`long_press` is structurally the same as `click`:

1. `node_action_long_click`
2. `gesture_long_press`

It also benefits from semantic target promotion.

### type

`type` has two modes:

- targeted: resolve target, try `SetTextOnNodeAt`, then optionally `TapAt -> SetTextOnFocused`
- focused: directly call `SetTextOnFocused`

The tap-to-focus fallback is disabled in VD mode because the IME may land on the wrong display.

Each attempt explicitly checks for `ActionResult.Cancelled` and propagates it as `ActionOutcome.Cancelled` rather than falling through to the next attempt.

### scroll

`scroll` accepts a content direction, not finger direction:

- `down` means reveal lower content
- `up` means reveal upper content
- `left` means reveal leftward content
- `right` means reveal rightward content

Current channel order:

1. `a11y_scroll`
2. `gesture_swipe`

If a target element is supplied (via `element_index` or `text`) and it resolves to bounds, the gesture is computed inside that area. If an explicit semantic target fails to resolve, the scroll returns `Failed` immediately — no silent fallback to full-display scroll. Only no-target calls use full-display bounds.

Scroll **never uses coordinate fallback**: if the semantic target misses but a coordinate hint is present, the scroll still fails. A single hint point has no scroll area and no synthetic bounds are created from it. This is the deliberate exception to the coordinate-hint normalization described in the Contract section.

### swipe

`swipe` is raw precision gesture. It does not try to infer direction or semantics.

This is the escape hatch for sliders, drag-like interactions, and custom surfaces.

If the gesture is cancelled by the system (e.g., coroutine cancellation), the executor returns `ActionOutcome.Cancelled` rather than `Failed`.

## Resolution and verification pipeline

For `click` and `long_press`, the pipeline is:

1. Resolve target to a point and optional semantic hint.
2. Bounds-check the resolved point against display size.
3. For semantic targets, promote non-actionable child nodes to an actionable container, then select the nearest actionable child hotspot within that container (falling back to container center if no child qualifies).
4. Dispatch the first channel.
5. Capture post-action screen state after settle delay (300ms).
6. If unchanged, retry at +500ms; if still unchanged, final retry at +1000ms (1800ms total budget).
7. If still unchanged: return success with `verified=false` and warning. No fallback to next channel.
8. If the channel dispatch itself fails (not accepted), try the next channel.

This is the critical current behavior: dispatch acceptance alone is not enough for success.

## What counts as success now

The runtime distinguishes three layers:

1. `action accepted`
2. `observable screen change`
3. `semantic task correctness`

`mobile_action` only owns the first two.

### Accepted and changed

This is the strongest action success:

- Android accepted the primitive call
- post-action capture shows the UI changed

### Accepted but unchanged

For point actions, this is now treated as unverified success — the action returns `Success` with `verified=false` and a warning message. The LLM sees the warning and can decide whether to retry.

Previous behavior (before `2042beb`) treated `Unchanged` as channel failure and fell through to the next channel. This caused double-click bugs when the click actually succeeded but screen content happened to stay the same (e.g. a random number repeating).

### Unverifiable

If post-action capture fails entirely, the action may still return success with `verified=false`.

This is reserved for cases where the action probably executed but the tool could not capture enough evidence afterward.

That is a tooling limitation, not a semantic proof of success.

## What `UiChangeDetector` actually sees

[UiChangeDetector.kt](../../../../app/src/main/kotlin/ai/closepaw/tool/action/UiChangeDetector.kt) computes a fingerprint from:

- element identity and order
- resource id
- class name
- text
- description
- hint text
- bounds
- enabled/selected/checked/checkable state (NOT isFocused — excluded to prevent false positives from transient focus shifts on list item click)
- range info
- keyboard visibility
- screenshot perceptual hash if the a11y tree is empty

This improves detection, but it still measures observable change, not task truth.

## Ownership boundaries

The click stack fails for three fundamentally different reasons. They must not be conflated.

### Our logic bug

This is ours if any of these are true:

- target resolution picks the wrong node
- coordinate translation is wrong
- fallback order is wrong
- clickable-ancestor promotion picks the wrong container
- overlay pass-through is broken for our own gesture path
- we declare success after a no-op

These are runtime bugs and should be fixed in code.

### Android accessibility limitation

This is platform-limited when:

- node action returns accepted but the widget ignores it
- gesture injection is accepted but the app does not respond
- a widget only responds to real user touch sequences or a different gesture shape

Even then, we still own good detection and fallback inside the reachable platform envelope.

### App-specific behavior

Some apps wire open/select/drag behavior in unusual ways. That is not automatically our bug.

But if we can detect the pattern cleanly and route to a more faithful mechanism without app-specific hacks everywhere, that is still worth implementing.

## Known hard case: Files row open (partially addressed)

As of 2026-03-06, the Files `task.html` row open regression was traced to two separate issues:

**1. Container-center dead zone** — `refinePointActionTarget()` rewriting the click point to `container.center`. Fixed (`04618f3`) by selecting the nearest actionable child hotspot within the promoted container.

**2. UiChangeDetector false positive** — `ACTION_CLICK` on RecyclerView items triggers `isFocused` state change without actually opening the file. The detector incorrectly reported "Changed". Fixed (`5ee310a`) by excluding `isFocused` from the fingerprint and extending the verify window to 1800ms.

**3. Remaining platform limitation** — `gesture_tap` (via `AccessibilityService.dispatchGesture()`) is a false success on Files RecyclerView items: accepted by the framework but produces no UI change. `node_action_click` (via `performAction(ACTION_CLICK)`) is the only reliable channel for this surface, working in both A11Y and VD modes.

Transport reliability on Files RecyclerView (API 34 emulator, `edb4acd`):

| Transport | Display 0 | VD Secondary Display |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| `node_action_click` | ✅ 8/8 | ✅ (via a11y, display-agnostic) |
| `adb shell input tap` | ✅ | ❌ (secondary display routing) |
| `dispatchGesture` | ❌ false success | N/A |
| Shizuku `injectInputEvent` | ❌ false success* | ❌* |

\*Shizuku results may reflect test setup issues (ad-hoc initialization outside normal VD lifecycle) rather than a transport-level limitation. On most other app surfaces, all four transports work correctly. This is scoped to Files RecyclerView.

**4. First-click-after-launch failure** — Reproduced in BrowserMultiply eval (A11Y: `20260306_230038` T2, VD: `20260306_232810` T2-T3). `node_action_click` on `task.html` returns `true` but UI does not change, even after 1800ms verify window. After other interactions on the same Files screen (e.g. `long_press` → context menu → dismiss), the same `node_action_click` succeeds. Both A11Y and VD modes show identical behavior. Root cause unknown — the a11y tree is identical before and after the failed click.

**5. Unchanged-fallback double-click** — Fixed in `2042beb`. Previously, when `UiChangeDetector` saw `Unchanged` after `node_action_click`, the executor fell through to `gesture_tap` as a "retry". If the click actually succeeded but the screen content happened to stay the same (e.g. a button that shows a random number and the same number appears twice), this caused a spurious second click. Observed in BrowserMultiply A11Y run T16: 4th button click produced the same number → detector saw `Unchanged` → fell back to `gesture_tap` → extra click overwrote the 5th number. Fix: `Unchanged` now returns `Success` with `verified=false` and a warning — the LLM decides whether to retry, no automatic fallback.

## Why this documentation matters

`mobile_action` is not just a schema. It is the foundation of the agent's physical reliability.

If the tool cannot clearly distinguish:

- target identity
- primitive dispatch
- observable effect

then the agent will compensate with prompt hacks and task-specific workarounds. That is the wrong layer.

The correct direction is:

- keep targeting single-path
- keep platform primitives atomic
- keep executor semantics explicit
- isolate Android/app limits with clean probes
- only add app-specific tactics after the mechanism boundary is proven
